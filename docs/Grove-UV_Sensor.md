The Grove – UV Sensor is used for detecting the intensity of incident ultraviolet(UV) radiation. This form of electromagnetic radiation has shorter wavelengths than visible radiation. The Grove - UV Sensor is based on the sensor GUVA-S12D which has a wide spectral range of 200nm-400nm. The module outputs electrical signal which varies with the UV intensity, which gives your suggestion if it is a good idea to beach today.

Application Ideas
-----

* UV sensors are used in many different applications, include pharmaceuticals, automobiles, and robotics.
* UV sensors are also used in the printing industry for solvent handling and dyeing processes.
* In addition, UV sensors are used in the chemical industry for the production, storage, and transportation of chemicals as well.

The theory of UV sensor is: In sunlight, the UV index and Photocurrent are a linear relationship.

About our Grove - UV Sensor, we have converted Photocurrent to corresponding voltage value collected by Arduino/Seeeduino. The output voltage and the UV index is linear:

**illumination intensity = 307 * Vsig**

Vsig is the value of voltage measured from the SIG pin of the Grove interface, unit V.
illumination intensity unit: mW/m<sup>2</sup> for the combination strength of UV light with wavelength range: 240nm~370nm

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
To calculate the UV index value, please refer to <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/sunwise/uv-index">US EPA</a>. It is hard to say that the measurement from this sensor can be converted to the EPA standard UV index, but can be estimated roughly.

UV Index = illumination intensity / 200

Getting Started
--------------

!!!Note
    This chapter is based on Win10 and Arduino IDE 1.6.9

We will show you how this Grove - UV Sensor works through a simple demo. First of all, you need to prepare the below stuffs:

| Seeeduino V4 | Grove - UV Sensor | Base Shield |

  **Connection**

  Thanks to the benefits of Grove series modules, you don't need to make soldering or bread board, what you need to do is to connect the modules to the right port of Base Shield. For this demo, we only need one Grove module.
-   Connect Grove UV Sensor to A0 port of Grove - Base Shield.
-   Plug the Grove - Base Shield into Arduino/Seeeduino and connect them to PC by using a USB cable.
-   The demo code is shown below.

![enter image description here](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-UV_Sensor/raw/master/img/connection.jpg)

  **Upload the sketch to Arduino and open the serial port to monitor the data**

```
// modified by Victor
// to calculate UV index directly
void setup(){

    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop()
{
    int sensorValue;
    long  sum=0;
    for(int i=0;i<1024;i++)// accumulate readings for 1024 times
    {
        sensorValue=analogRead(A0);
        sum=sensorValue+sum;
        delay(2);
    }
    long meanVal = sum/1024;  // get mean value
    Serial.print("The current UV index is:");
    Serial.print((meanVal*1000/4.3-83)/21);// get a detailed calculating expression for UV index in schematic files.
    Serial.print("\n");
    delay(20);

}
```

## Try it in JAVA!

Check out this tutorial for the [Grove UV Sensor](https://github.com/oci-pronghorn/FogLight-Grove/blob/master/UVSensor/README.md).   
Its part of the open source framework FogLight where  many of the [Grove Devices](https://github.com/oci-pronghorn/FogLight-Grove) are supported. 
It was designed for IoT applications and provides an integrated web server.
