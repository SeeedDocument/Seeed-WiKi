Zephyr applications use the nrf52_nitrogen configuration to run on the nRF52 Nitrogen hardware. It provides support for the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52832 ARM Cortex-M4F CPU and the following devices:

* NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller)
* SYSTICK (System Tick System Clock)
* UART
* GPIO
* FLASH

The [Nordic Semiconductor Infocenter](http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/) contains the processor's information and the datasheet.

It is strongly recommended that you update your development environment with the latest [SDK](https://www.zephyrproject.org/downloads/tools) since new functionality is tested against the latest releases.
