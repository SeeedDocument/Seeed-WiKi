This Moisture Senor can be used for detecting the moisture of soil or judge if there is water around the sensor, let the plant in your garden able to reach out for human's help when they are thirsty. This sensor is very easy to use, you can just simply insert in into the soil and read the data. With this sensor, you can make a small project that can let the plant send a message to you like " I am thirsty now, please feed me some water."

## Usage
---
**With Arduino**

This is a summary of the moisture sensor which can be used to detect the moisture of the soil. When the soil moisture deflicits, the sensor output value will decrease. You can know whether a plant needs water or not by observing the result that the sensor output. The following sketch demostrates a simple application of sensoring the moisture of the soil.

- Connect this module to one of analog port of A0 of [Grove - Base Shield](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Base-Shield-p-754.html) with 4 pin Grove cable, and then insert the sensor into the soil or plase it in anywhere you want.

- Plug Grove - Base Shield into the Arduino Seeeduino and connect Arduino to PC via an USB cable.

The hardware installation as is shown as below:

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Grove_Moisture_Sensor/raw/master/images/518px-Moisture1.jpg)

!!!Note
    This sensor isn't hardened against contaimination or exposure of the control circuitry to water and may be prone to electrolytic corrosion across the probes, so it isn't well suited to being left in place or used outdoors.

- Copy and paste the code below to a new Arduino Sketh

```c
// Test code for Grove - Moisture Sensor 
int sensorPin = A0; // select the input pin for the potentiometer
int sensorValue = 0; // variable to store the value coming from the sensor7

void setup() {
    // declare the ledPin as an OUTPUT:
    Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop() {
    // read the value from the sensor:
    sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);
    Serial.print("sensor = " );
    Serial.println(sensorValue);
    delay(1000);
}
```

Taking care of your plants(Moisture Sensor)

The following sketch demonstrates a simple application of sensing the moisture in soil.With this, you can know whether your plant needs water or not by observing the result from the output of the sensor

/*
  Moisture-Sensor
  The following sketch demonstrates a simple application of sensing
  the moisture of the soil. You can know whether a plant needs water
  or not by observing the results that the sensor outputs.
  The circuit:
    * Moisture-Sensor attached to pin 24 (J6 plug on Grove Base BoosterPack)
    * one side pin (either one) to ground
    * the other side pin to +VCC
    * LED anode (long leg) attached to RED_LED
    * LED cathode (short leg) attached to ground
  - NOTE:
    This example code is in the public domain.

**With Raspberry Pi**
1. You should have got a Raspberry Pi and a grove pi or grove pi+
2. You should have completed configuring development environment, otherwise follow here.
3. Connection
- Plug the sensor to grove pi socket A0 by using a grove cable
4. Navigate to the demo's directory.

```
cd yourpath/GrovePi/Software/Python/
```

To see the code

```python
nano grove_moisture_sensor.py # "Ctrl+x" to exit #
import time
import grovepi
# Connect the Grove Moisture Sensor to analog port A0
# SIG,NC,VCC,GND
sensor = 0
while True:
try:
print grovepi.analogRead(sensor)
time.sleep(.5)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
break
except IOError:
print "Error
```

5. Run the demo

```
sudo python grove_moisture_sensor.py
```
## Try it in JAVA!

Check out this tutorial for the [Grove Moisture Sensor](https://github.com/oci-pronghorn/FogLight-Grove/blob/master/MoistureSensor/README.md).   
Its part of the open source framework FogLight where  many of the [Grove Devices](https://github.com/oci-pronghorn/FogLight-Grove) are supported. 
It was designed for IoT applications and provides an integrated web server.
