# Arch BLE

Introduction
------------

Arch BLE is an mbed enabled development board based Nordic nRF51822. With Arduino form factor and Grove connectors, it is extremely easy to create a bluetooth low energy device.

The nRF51822 is a powerful multi-protocol single chip solution for ULP wireless applications. It incorporates Nordic’s latest best-in-class performance radio transceiver, an ARM Cortex M0 MCU and 256kB flash + 16kB RAM memory. The nRF51822 supports Bluetooth® low energy and 2.4 GHz protocol stacks.

Get Started
-----------

![](/asset/Arch_BLE/img/Get_started_with_mbed.png)

1.  Click [this link](https://developer.mbed.org/compiler/#import:/teams/mbed/code/mbed_blinky/;platform:Seeed-Arch-BLE) to **login or signup to mbed**
2.  Import the mbed\_blinky program
3.  Click the **Compile** icon of the top toolbar to compile the program, then download a compiled hex file.
4.  Drag-n-drop the downloaded hex file into the MBED disk

You can open **main.cpp** to change the program. For example, use the following code to blink the LED every 0.1s

    #include "mbed.h"

    DigitalOut led(p30);           // on-board led is connected to p30

    int main()
    {
        while (true) {
            led = !led;
            wait(0.1);
        }
    }

***Note***

If you get a compiling error that 'device.h' is not find, try to update the mbed library to the latest revision in your program.

Applications

If the BLE device is disconnected frequently, we can improve the stability by changing the BLE parameters - Advertising Duration (main.cpp), Min Interval and Max Interval (nRF51822/projectconfig.h)

Update or Restore Firmware
--------------------------

The latest firmware version for the Arch BLE is v0203 built at Oct 08 2014. To check your firmware version and built date, open the MBED.HTM file of your MBED disk in a text editor.

Changelog:

-   2014-06-26 first version
-   2014-08-25 support to drag-n-drop hex file generated by gcc toolchain and without softdevice
-   2014-10-08 use USB EJECT INSET instead of reconnecting USB, increase intel hex data line buffer (from 64 bytes to 128 bytes)

Known issues:

-   issues when directly downloading the hex file into the MBED disk with the Chrome browser. The reason is the Chrome will create a temporary file to save the downloading data. When using the Chrome, please save your hex file to other place and then copy it to the MBED disk.

Firmware:

-   [The firmware v0203 2014-10-08 for Arch BLE](https://developer.mbed.org/media/uploads/yihui/lpc11u35_nrf51822_if_mbed_v203_20141008.bin)
-   [The firmware v0203 2014-08-25 for Arch BLE](https://developer.mbed.org/media/uploads/yihui/lpc11u35_nrf51822_if_mbed_v203_20140825.bin)

To flash a new firmware:

-   Hold the Arch BLE's button and power on it
-   A CRP DISABLD disk will pop up
    -   On Windows, replace firmware.bin with the above firmware
    -   On Linux/Mac, use command: **dd if={new\_firmware.bin} of={firmware.bin} conv=notrunc**
