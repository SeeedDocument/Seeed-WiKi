The Grove - Light sensor integrates a photo-resistor(light dependent resistor) to detect the intensity of light. The resistance of photo-resistor decreases when the intensity of light increases. A dual OpAmp chip LM358 on board produces voltage corresponding to intensity of light(i.e. based on resistance value). The output signal is analog value, the brighter the light is, the larger the value.

This module can be used to build a light controlled switch i.e. switch off lights during day time and switch on lights during night time.


!!!Warning
    The light sensor value only reflects the approximated trend of the intensity of light, it DOES NOT represent the exact Lumen.

## Getting Started

!!!Note
    This part is besed on Grove - Light Sensor(P) V1.0.

Here we will show you how this Grove - Light Sensor works via a simple demo. First of all, you need to prepare the below stuffs:

### Connection

Thanks to the benefit of Grove series module, you don't need soldering or bread board, what you need to do is connecting the modules to the appropriate grove port of Base Shield. For this demo, we will use 2 Grove modules.

* Grove - Light Sensor is an analog output module, let's connect it to **A0**.
* Grove - LED Bar is a digital input module with a 2-wire bus, let's connect it to **D2**

### Download sketch

There's a sketchbook for Seeeduino Stalker V3.1, which includes:

* Example of read raw value of the sensor
* Example of this getting started
* Example of the secret box demo
* LED Bar library

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove_Light_Sensor/master/images/sketch_download.png)](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Sketch_Grove_Light_Sensor)

Download the sketch and put it at anywhere, open Arduino IDE, **File > Reference**, and copy the location path to **Sketchbook location**, then click on OK. Reopen Arduino IDE, then the sketchbook is set.

### Upload the code to Arduino

Open Arduino IDE, **File > Sketchbook > GettingStarted** to open the code for this part.

Then choose the right Board and COM port, and then click on the Upload button, this process will take seconds. Then let's try to cover the light sensor with your hand, you will find LED Bar reduce its led.

### Get Raw Data

If you don't need a Grove - LED Bar, there's another example you can try, Open Arduino IDE, **File > Sketchbook > RawData** to open the code, after uploaded the example to Seeeduino V4, click on **Serial > Plotter** to get the changing curve of the sensor.

### Project: Secret Box

Here we will show you a project made with Grove - Light Sensor - Secret Box. First you need a box, a paper box, wooden box, any box is ok. Put something in the box, because we named it secret box, that means we don't want anybody to open it, otherwise there will be an alarm to inform you.

Here we use LinkIt ONE as the controller, which is an Arduino compatible board and consist of rich function. And you need things below:

* [LinkIt ONE](http://www.seeedstudio.com/LinkIt-ONE-p-2017.html)
* Grove - Light Sensor
* Grove - Base Shield
* A Sim Card

Let's connect Grove - Light Sensor to A0 or Base Shield, and open Arduino IDE, **File > Sketchbook > SecretBox**, what you need to do is upload the example to LinkIt ONE. Then someone open the box, the light will detect it, and send you a SMS.

Have fun.

## Try it in JAVA!

Check out this tutorial for the [Grove Light Sensor](https://github.com/oci-pronghorn/FogLight-Grove/blob/master/LightSensor/README.md).   
Its part of the open source framework FogLight where  many of the [Grove Devices](https://github.com/oci-pronghorn/FogLight-Grove) are supported. 
It was designed for IoT applications and provides an integrated web server.   

##Project

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Lotus/master/img/gun.jpg)

Inspired by OVERWATCH, we have made a very cool Wooden Laser Gun toy for fun these day!

The Wooden Laser Gun and the Gun Target are all based on an Arduino board called Seeeduino Lotus. The laser emitter on the Laser Gun is controlled to fire laser pulse to "activate" the Gun Target. And there are 3 light sensors on the Gun Target to detect the laser pulse. It seems very simple right? If you are interested in our project, please make one for yourself or your child! It's worth to spend one day DIY it as a Xmas present.
