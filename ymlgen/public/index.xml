      <description>Arduino hadn’t debugging function, maybe this is the first impression of some software engineers. In fact, often we just use the Arduino to do some simple application, even there’s no debugging, and it does not matter. If you want to use the Arduino to do some complex application, such as face recognition, then maybe you have to rethink if you had chosen the wrong platform.
As for some simple application, we can use serial print to debug, and Arduino had provided a very easy to use serial print function.</description>

      <description>Debugging with OpenOCD and gdb Please use openocd 4.0 or newer.
This example assumes you have a Segger J-Link compatible JTAG adapter between your computer and the device (or dev board) you are debugging. It is possible to use an SWD (ST-Link) adapter instead, for this use openocd 0.7 or newer.
Start the openocd server with configuration files matching your hardware:
openocd -f interface/jlink.cfg -f target/stm32.cfg  Or, if you are using SWD:</description>

      <description>Running STM32 code on the qemu emulator With the qemu emulator you can run and debug arm code without any arm processor!
You can load the code onto the emulator, connect the gdb debugger and step through the code. Of course, peripherals, timers and other microcontroller components will not be emulated, but it is helpful for verifying some of the code.
You will need to run the qemu-system-arm which is part of the QEMU project.</description>

      <description>How to build the DSO Nano firmware using gcc The DSO Nano firmware can be build with a gcc toolchain. The gcc-specific files reside in the project/gcc folder of the firmware source code tree.
Get a ARM cross-building gcc toolchain The ARM toolchain most of us use is the GCC from ARM at &amp;lt;https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded&amp;gt;.
For Linux, you can choose the tarball or the installer. The latter is a much larger download than the former, for some reason.</description>

 AC Calibration (slope response, overshooting)
 For 1 &amp;hellip; 10V/div
 For 50 &amp;hellip; 500mV/div
 For x10 probe
  Zero Offset This calibration is done nearly automatically. The DSO should be well at operating temperature for this. So you should have turned it on at least about 10 minutes earlier. After selection of &amp;ldquo;Calibr&amp;rdquo; from the &amp;ldquo;Save/Recall&amp;rdquo; menu (&amp;ldquo;Square&amp;rdquo; Button, scrolling to last item, pushing -/+ button) you are asked to short CH_A input to GND.</description>

      <description>This sensor is designed for comprehensive monitor over indoor air condition. It&amp;rsquo;s responsive to a wide scope of harmful gases, as carbon monoxide, alcohol, acetone, thinner, formaldehyde and so on. Due to the measuring mechanism, this sensor can&amp;rsquo;t output specific data to describe target gases&amp;rsquo; concentrations quantitatively. But it&amp;rsquo;s still competent enough to be used in applications that require only qualitative results, like auto refresher sprayers and auto air cycling systems.</description>

      <description>An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by electric current. An electric current flowing in a wire creates a magnetic field around the wire, due to Ampere&amp;rsquo;s law(see drawing below). To concentrate the magnetic field, in an electromagnet the wire is wound into a coil with many turns of wire lying side by side. The magnetic field of all the turns of wire passes through the center of the coil, creating a strong magnetic field there.</description>

      <description>##What is the Grove System?
Grove is a modular, standardized connector prototyping system. Grove takes a building block approach to assembling electronics. Compared to the jumper or solder based system, it is easier to connect, experiment and build and simplifies the learning system, but not to the point where it becomes dumbed down. Some of the other prototype systems out there takes the level down to building blocks. Good stuff to be learned that way, but the Grove system allows you to build real systems.</description>

      <guid>http://wiki.seeed.cc/how_to_choose_the_right_cable/</guid>
      <description>A Bad Example Here we will introduce a variety of cables that Seeed offers. When you make a demo, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to avoid jumping a wire. To be honest, I hate jump a wire, it&amp;rsquo;s really a mess. But sometimes you had to jump a wire, you couldn&amp;rsquo;t make a PCB for an easy application.
We had to admit that jumping a wire is necessary, then why not choose some right cable, to make our demo more neatly.</description>

      <description>In another document, we have made a detailed introduction about Library, we know that Library really very easy to use! Download a Library, put it to the Arduino libraries directory, open the example and it works.
However, sometimes we will encounter this problem: You made an interesting demo, this demo needs to contain some libraries, and you would like to share this demo, so you need to send the code to some guys, but there is often a compilation error problem: missing certain library.</description>

      <description>How to Measure Capacitance The complete capacitance measurement system is composed by sensing electrode pads connected to MPR121 sensing inputs, and the MPR121 communicating with the host processor via I2C bus and interrupt output.
The capacitance measured on each sensing channel is the total capacitance to ground which can be the combination of background parasitic capacitance to ground(Cb) and finger touch induced capacitance to ground(Cx). The MPR121 uses a constant DC charge current scheme for capacitance measurement.</description>

      <description>What We&amp;rsquo;re Doing
In the previous sections, we learned how to control the circuit&amp;rsquo;s input and output using digital interface. In this section, we will learn how to vary the output using an analog device called a potentiometer (also known as a variable resistor). A potentiometer is used to vary the voltage in the range of 0 ~ 5V. The MPU reads the voltage value in the range of 0-1023.This can be used to control the brightness of the LED (PWM simulation output interface).</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s time to know about new sensors that could make our projects even more interesting. A photoresistor (light dependent resistor or photocell) is a light sensor which varies its resistance value based on the intensity of the ambient light. A buzzer is a electro-acoustic device used to generate standard tone when it is connected to the power supply. Lets use both these components in our experiments.
